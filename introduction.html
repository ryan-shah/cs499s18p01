<h1>Introduction</h1>
Spydr's Threads is a web based tool for scheduling a sequence of week-nightly recurring processes. This tool should be aware of dependent processes that need to be run and ensure that these are executed first. The user should also be able to specify what percentage of the server's resources the program can utilize to ensure the number of threaded processes does not prevent the system from serving other users. In the same vein, the program should dynamically load these processes so that no process is started when there are not enough resources to handle it. Finally, a user should be able to add new processes to the list and edit existing ones.
