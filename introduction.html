<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Our project, in summary, was to create a process management tool for Fishback Management and Research Inc. They are a stock trading company that manage a software called ODDS Option Apps. As part of maintaining this software, they have many different PHP and Bash 
scripts that they run in sequence every night to keep their databases and customer facing products up to date and working properly. They were having issues with the length of time this process takes, as in the current process each script must be executed one at a 
time, right after each other. As a result, this means the total run time can be several hours. This method is also inflexible; making any changes to how or when the scripts are run is a tedious and cumbersome process that is error prone. Our task was to work with 
the customer find a solution to this problem, in addition to creating a web based portal to manage these scripts and which ones are run each night.

<p>
Our solution is Spydr's Threads (Spydr). This will solve the time issue by intelligently running groups of scripts in parallel threads, while also ensuring dependencies are satisfied and nothing is run out of order. This will also solve the inflexibility issue by 
allowing the user to make changes to their process as well as other processes if the user wishes. This utility will be accessed by Fishback server administrators via a web portal that allows them to create/edit/remove scripts in addition to being able to 
add/remove them from the schedules of scripts to as the user desires.
