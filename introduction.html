<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Spydr's Threads (Spydr) is a web based tool that we will be developing that schedules a sequence of week-nightly recurring scripts. These scripts perform variety of functions including both database and website management. Spyder should be aware of dependent processes that need to be run before certain scripts and ensure that these are executed first. 
</p>
<p>
Spyder will be accessed by ODDS server administrators who should be able to specify what percentage of the server's resources Spydr can utilize to ensure the number of threaded processes does not prevent the system from serving other users. In the same vein of thought, Spyder should dynamically load these processes so that no process is started when there are not enough resources to handle it. Finally, users should be able to add a new processes or script to Spydr in addition to editing the dependencies and order of existing ones.
