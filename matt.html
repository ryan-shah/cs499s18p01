        <h1>Matt's Weekly Contributions</h1>
          <h2>Week 1 (2/2 - 2/9)</h2>
            <p>This week we met with the customer and discussed what the project was, its requirements and specifications, and established how frequently we will meet in the future. We also set up our website this week, completing the introduction and requirements sections. Aside from setting up the website, we talked about the technical aspects of how we are going to satisfy the requirements of the project, and how we can effectively delegate work and remain on schedule. </p>
<br>

        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h2>2/10 - 2/17</h2>
        <p>This week we were given the login information that we needed to access the customer's server. We also decided that we are going to use Laravel as our PHP framework. We had our second meeting with the customer on Friday, however this was a very brief meeting. This is because we had just been given the login information to the server and had not had time to work on much.</p>
<br>

	<h2>Week 3 (2/17 - 2/23)</h2>
	<p>This week I further discussed with the team the design of our project and how we wish to implement certain things, such as how the database that we are going to use should be set up. We also talked about our presentation and how we would like for it to be structured.</p>
<br>

	<h2>Week 4 (2/24 - 3/2)</h2>
	<p>This week I met with the team and we finished the design portion of the project. We also decided on what each person was going to talk about during the presentation next week, and created accompanying powerpoint slides to go along with it. We were going to meet with the customer this week but rescheduled to next week so that we would have our design finished for the time of the meeting.</p>
<br>

	<h2>Week 7 (3/17 - 3/23)</h2>
	<p>This week the team and I met with you about how we need to improve the website so that it better shows our understanding of the project. We also met with the customer again this week. We showed them how the website had progressed and discussed the timeline for the rest of the semester. We are now beginning to think of test cases for the project.</p>
