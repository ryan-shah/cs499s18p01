        <h1>Matt's Weekly Contributions</h1>
          <h2>Week 1 (2/2 - 2/9)</h2>
            <p>This week we met with the customer and discussed what the project was, its requirements and specifications, and established how frequently we will meet in the future. We also set up our website this week, completing the introduction and requirements sections. Aside from setting up the website, we talked about the technical aspects of how we are going to satisfy the requirements of the project, and how we can effectively delegate work and remain on schedule. </p>
<br>

        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h2>2/10 - 2/17</h2>
        <p>This week we were given the login information that we needed to access the customer's server. We also decided that we are going to use Laravel as our PHP framework. We had our second meeting with the customer on Friday, however this was a very brief meeting. This is because we had just been given the login information to the server and had not had time to work on much.</p>
<br>

	<h2>Week 3 (2/17 - 2/23)</h2>
	<p>This week I further discussed with the team the design of our project and how we wish to implement certain things, such as how the database that we are going to use should be set up. We also talked about our presentation and how we would like for it to be structured.</p>
