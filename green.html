	<h1>Week 1</h1>
	<h2>2/2 - 2/9</h2>
	<p>This week we met with our client, Don Fishback, as well as the programmers that work for him. They were clear and detailed in what they wanted from us, so I think working for them will be a joy. They haven't given access to the resources that we need to start much meaningful programming, but in the meantime we've been considering what PHP we would like to use for this project. There hasn't been much cntribute to this week except conversation, but we plan to start work on the programming very soon.</p>

	<h1>Week 2</h1>
	<h2>2/10 - 2/17</h2>
	<p>This week, not much new happened. Our customer emailed us back with the information we needed to access their servers and begin development at the end of this week. We met with them on Friday, but because they were very busy this week they hadn't had the time to come up with anything new to tell us. This week we plan on getting started on wat we can - The frontend of the website and the installation of Laravel on the server. It was my job to figure out the installation details and this coming week to handle the installation.</p>

	<h1>Week 3</h1>
	<h2>2/18 - 2/25</h2>
	<p>This week was another slow one. I got Laravel up and running on the server, and we divided up the various parts of the program - Matt has the database, Elijah has the website frontend, Ryan has the C++ runner program, and I have the website backend. My job going forward will require a lot of collaboration between the others on the team - not much backend work can be donw without the database or knowing what data to expect from the front end.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Week 4</h1>
	<h2>2/26 - 3/5</h2>
	<p>This week we got a lot more planning done. Coming up with the midterm presentation allowed us to iron out some details that not everyone was clear on before, such as the actual look of the website and the way the data would be passed back and forth. I am continuing to work on connecting the three parts together, this week specifically by connecting the database to the website.</p>
