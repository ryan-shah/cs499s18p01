	<h1>Week 1</h1>
	<h2>2/2 - 2/9</h2>
	<p>This week we met with our client, Don Fishback, as well as the programmers that work for him. They were clear and detailed in what they wanted from us, so I think working for them will be a joy. They haven't given access to the resources that we need to start much meaningful programming, but in the meantime we've been considering what PHP we would like to use for this project. There hasn't been much cntribute to this week except conversation, but we plan to start work on the programming very soon.</p>
