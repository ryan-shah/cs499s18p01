	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a senior majoring in Computer Science  with a minor in Music History and Theory, graduating in May. I enjoy playing music and all things outdoors in my free time. You can contact me at alijah.green@uky.edu.</p>

	<h1>Week 1</h1>
	<h2>2/2 - 2/9</h2>
	<p>This week we met with our client, Don Fishback, as well as the programmers that work for him. They were clear and detailed in what they wanted from us, so I think working for them will be a joy. They haven't given access to the resources that we need to start much meaningful programming, but in the meantime we've been considering what PHP we would like to use for this project. There hasn't been much cntribute to this week except conversation, but we plan to start work on the programming very soon.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Week 2</h1>
	<h2>2/10 - 2/17</h2>
	<p>This week, not much new happened. Our customer emailed us back with the information we needed to access their servers and begin development at the end of this week. We met with them on Friday, but because they were very busy this week they hadn't had the time to come up with anything new to tell us. This week we plan on getting started on wat we can - The frontend of the website and the installation of Laravel on the server. It was my job to figure out the installation details and this coming week to handle the installation.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Week 3</h1>
	<h2>2/18 - 2/25</h2>
	<p>This week was another slow one. I got Laravel up and running on the server, and we divided up the various parts of the program - Matt has the database, Elijah has the website frontend, Ryan has the C++ runner program, and I have the website backend. My job going forward will require a lot of collaboration between the others on the team - not much backend work can be donw without the database or knowing what data to expect from the front end.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Week 4</h1>
	<h2>2/26 - 3/5</h2>
	<p>This week we got a lot more planning done. Coming up with the midterm presentation allowed us to iron out some details that not everyone was clear on before, such as the actual look of the website and the way the data would be passed back and forth. I am continuing to work on connecting the three parts together, this week specifically by connecting the database to the website.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Week 5</h1>
	<h2>3/11 - 3/18</h2>
	<p>This week was spring break. I actually got quite a bit accomplished; I sporadically made changes to the frontend of the website throughout the week, and worked on it for a few hours straight on Saturday. After many hours of research and troubleshooting, we've still not gotten the database stuff squared away, though the final solution posed by James seems infallible. I will have to text him sometime this week in order to get that resolved. We still haven't need the database for much of anything yet, so it's still not a huge deal.</p>
	</body>

	<h1> Week 6 & 7</h1>
	<h2>3/19 - 4/1</h2>
	<p> These weeks a lot got done. I put in a lot more time into the frontend, changing around the way the programs on the sidebar get laid out as well as coming up with a decent way to display the statistics for each running list of programs. A lot more research on Bootstrap was done, and many fancy-looking components were added. I also began messing with the Javascript more seriously, diving into the world of jQuery and handling asynchronous POST requests (AJAX) in order to make the user experience more seamless. While that part has yet to be fully implemented, the foundation is strong, and (in theory) not a whole lot will need to be changed in order to make things work the way we want them to. I also got the database set up, opting to host my own public-facing MySQL database from my personal Raspberry Pi. None of the solutions that we thought of last time to access the database given to us by James and his team seemed to work, so instead of compromising the security of their production server, I made my own server. Everything works pretty much exactly the way one would expect. This has allowed us to better test how things will actually respond to real data, as we no longer have to hardcode everything directly into the website. </p>

	<h1> Week 8 & 9 </h1>
	<h2>4/2 - 4/15</h2>
	<p> These weeks were also quite productive. Everything that I talked about from the last entry is now functional. I have sucessfully written the jQuery that allows us to change the database with AJAX requests. This has allowed me to finish up all of the code for adding programs and runlists, as well as editing programs (which is almost complete, with only a few things missing). Editing runlists isn't available yet, as I just got done with the adding feature today. Also, I was able to get the code for adding dependencies to a program working (still, no editing). The inclusion of all these things means that the website can be almost functionally run from beginning (that is, adding a program and its dependencies to the database) to end (having the C++ program actually run everything). The only thing missing from the backend is the ability to write out the JSON that the C++ program looks for, which Elijah is currrently working on. <br> I have halted almost all progress on the frontend of the website. It's functional enough to get the necessary pieces together, so I don't see much benefit in investing much more time in it. The only other thing I'd like to get done on it before the ned of the semester is the ability to display all of the runlist and total statstics of running programs. This is not a very high priority though, so it will probably not get done.</p>
