<h1>Testing</h1>

<ol>
	<li><h2>Unit Testing</h2></li>
	For unit testing we will perform the following checks on the different components of our project:
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Website</h3></li>
		<ol>
			<li>Fetches Data from Database</li>
			<li>Updates Data in Database when form is submitted (add/edit/remove scripts/schedules)</li>
			<li>Displays forms properly</li>
			<li>Writes Schedule to config file when form is submitted</li>
			<li>Reads updated values from log file when schedule is run</li>
		</ol>
		<li><h3>C++ Program</h3></li>
		<ol>
			<li>Read data from config file</li>
			<li>Check current time and know when to run</li>
			<li>Check dependencies of script to see if script can run</li>
			<li>Check available memory to see if script can run</li>
			<li>Track running script and record its memory/runtime statistics</li>
			<li>Know when script finishes so dependencies can run</li>
			<li>Write to log files most recent execution statics for each script</li>
		<ol>
	</ul>
	<li><h2>Integration Tests</h2></li>
	These tests how our modules interact with each other so the following tests will check to make sure our connections in the process are working as intended.
	<ol>
		<li>Add/remove script/schedule to database and ensure it appears on website</li>
		<li>Add/remove script/schedule to website and ensure it appears in database</li>
		<li>Change runtime of schedule in database and ensure it appears on website</li>
		<li>Change runtime of schedule on website and ensure it changes in config file and C++ program starts on time</li>
		<li>On completion of C++ program ensure updated runtime statistics appear in database</li>
	</ol>
	<li><h2>System Testing</h2></li>
	There will not be a lot of different systems that need to be tested as this application will only run on the Linux server it was designed for. That being said, we will test the website's compatiblity with the following browsers that we know our customer's use:
	<ul>
		<li>Firefox 59.0.2</li>
		<li>Chrome 65.0.3325.185</li>
		<li>Safari 10.1</li>
	</ul>
	<li><h2>Acceptance Testing</h2></li>
	For acceptance testing, we will install Spydr onto the customer's server and they will add several "dummy scripts" that they use for testing into our database via the webpage. They will set up a schedule via this web portal as well and then see if it runs successfully and the total execution time is decreased and everything executed successfully. This will be the final test of our program before delivery.
</ol>
