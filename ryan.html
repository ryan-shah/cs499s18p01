	<h1>Weekly Contributions</h1>
	<h2>Week 1 (2/2/18 - 2/9/18)</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we met with Don Fishback and his partners in order to discuss the details of the project. Once this was ironed out, we spent the remainder of the week pondering how we might implement this project before our meeting on Friday. During this meeting we built the basis of our project website and discussed what PHP Framework we might use for the project. While we had originally discussed using codeigniter, some of us participated in a hackathon in Louisville (DerbyHacks) over the weekend where we learned there may be advantages to using Laravel instead. This will require more research but will probably be our framework of choice.</p>
