	<h1>Weekly Contributions</h1>
	<h2>Week 1 (2/2/18 - 2/9/18)</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we met with Don Fishback and his partners in order to discuss the details of the project. Once this was ironed out, we spent the remainder of the week pondering how we might implement this project before our meeting on Friday. During this meeting we built the basis of our project website and discussed what PHP Framework we might use for the project. While we had originally discussed using codeigniter, some of us participated in a hackathon in Louisville (DerbyHacks) over the weekend where we learned there may be advantages to using Laravel instead. This will require more research but will probably be our framework of choice.</p>

	<h2>Week 2 (2/10/18 - 2/17/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was largely unproductive as we had little contact from Don and Co. They encountered a major issue at work and were too busy to provide us with the tools needed to begin our work. I spent this time doing research on Larvel and how php frameworks work, until thursday when we were given login information to their server. We met the following day to go over what we can access, as we will be working on the production server, and to double check requirements. At the end of the week we came up with topics for each of us to work on, I will be focusing on how Threads work in PHP/C++.</p>
        <h2>Week 3 (2/18/18 - 2/24/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on getting a working example of threads working in C++. Once I was able to initiate a number of threads I focused on creating some example shell programs. Each of these were quite simple and just called the "sleep" command. The purpose of this was to prove that the threads were being executed concurrently as the sleep commands should terminate in order of length. The program worked successfully and proved that our project was indeed possible and can be completed on time. The next step is going to be creating a Class that contains each programs information. Additionally we made plans with what needs to be done by the end of the next week by my fellow groupmates. This includes a database schema and simple website layout.</p>
