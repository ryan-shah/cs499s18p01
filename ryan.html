	<h1>Weekly Contributions</h1>
	<h2>Week 1 (2/2/18 - 2/9/18)</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we met with Don Fishback and his partners in order to discuss the details of the project. Once this was ironed out, we spent the remainder of the week pondering how we might implement this project before our meeting on Friday. During this meeting we built the basis of our project website and discussed what PHP Framework we might use for the project. While we had originally discussed using codeigniter, some of us participated in a hackathon in Louisville (DerbyHacks) over the weekend where we learned there may be advantages to using Laravel instead. This will require more research but will probably be our framework of choice.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 2 (2/10/18 - 2/17/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was largely unproductive as we had little contact from Don and Co. They encountered a major issue at work and were too busy to provide us with the tools needed to begin our work. I spent this time doing research on Larvel and how php frameworks work, until thursday when we were given login information to their server. We met the following day to go over what we can access, as we will be working on the production server, and to double check requirements. At the end of the week we came up with topics for each of us to work on, I will be focusing on how Threads work in PHP/C++.</p>
	<br>
        <h2>Week 3 (2/18/18 - 2/24/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on getting a working example of threads working in C++. Once I was able to initiate a number of threads I focused on creating some example shell programs. Each of these were quite simple and just called the "sleep" command. The purpose of this was to prove that the threads were being executed concurrently as the sleep commands should terminate in order of length. The program worked successfully and proved that our project was indeed possible and can be completed on time. The next step is going to be creating a Class that contains each programs information. Additionally we made plans with what needs to be done by the end of the next week by my fellow groupmates. This includes a database schema and simple website layout.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 4 (2/25/18 - 3/3/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on working with the group as a whole to prepare our midterm presentation. As a part of this, we were able to develop the design for the website and getting a good start on the database schema. These were incorporated in the powerpoint which we will rehearse next week before we present on Wednesday. Additionally I focused on improving the C++ program and have reached the conclusion that I will need go launch child processes within threads, adding a new level of complexity to the system. <p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 5 (3/4/18 - 3/10/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was focused on getting our presentation fully polished and creating designs for the website to show our customers. We had our practice presentation on Monday, following which we made several changes to the slides and our presentation style. On Wed. we presented to the class (I think fairly well) and on Friday we met with our customer and gave them the same presentation to bring them up to speed with our work. Additionally we got verification on our website designs.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 6 (3/11/18 - 3/18/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was spring break and I planned to be very productive. Alas life got in the way and I was only able to dedicate a couple of hours to it on the 18th. I spent this time continuing the work I did in week 4 when I thought I would have to call fork() inside our threads (creating child processes) in order to get the PID of the programs. This however did not work as anticipated as the PID returned this way was different than the PID of the program called via the system() command. I tried getting the TID (thread ID) for each thread to see if that was the same as the program's PID but that turned out to be wrong as well. I then attempted to use one of the many exec() calls ( execl() to be specific ) as these replace the current process with the one specified as the parameter. My thought was that it would simply replace the thread (or in a following attempt the forked process) and the PID/TID would be the same, but instead the first call of exec() replaced the entire spyder process. After several hours of troubleshooting, the work around I have found is to call the process in one thread and then have another thread go through the /proc/{pid}/stat files until I find the pid of a process with the correct name. This however has its own issue as there is a race condition between the system() call in the first thread and the searching for the directory in the second. My work around for this is calling sleep(1) in the second thread so the system() call goes through, but this feels like bad programming and I will be searching for an alternative solution</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 7 (3/19/18 - 3/24/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on refining the C++ program into the more traditional Object-Orieted format of C++ with header/class files for easier understanding. I also focused on implementing the functions that read system memory and record process memory from the /proc/meminfo and proc/PID/stat files respectively. On Friday of this week we met with the customer for approval of our implementation and to make sure we have not missed any of their requirments. During this meeting we also showed them the flowcharts for the C++ program and website and informed them of the consessions to the tracing utility I made last week so that they could modify the time delay if they need to in the future.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 8 (3/25/18 - 3/31/18)</h2>
	<p>I spent this week continuing to work on the C++ program. I was able to complete the functionality of starting the program on time, and began the process of retroactively adding comments to parts of my code I did not document very well. Additionally, I spent some time editing the Makefile so that each .cpp file was compiled into its own object file, to better track down any future bugs as well as to make future additions to the program easier. At the end of the week, Elijah, Matt, and I (Alijah had a job interview and was unable to join us) gathered to create the preliminary test cases for the project as well as make changes to previous website submissions to use the same terminology and to clear up parts of our project that were not descirbed very well. As a final contribution for the week, we developed the JSON format we plan on using to communicate from the website to the C++ program.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Week 9 (4/1/18 - 4/7/18)</h2>
	<p>I spent this week, as I did the previous few, working on the C++ programs. I was able to verify that our dependency structure worked, and that dependent programs are run in the proper sequence. Additionally, on Friday we met with Don and Co. to discuss the last few weeks of our project. In 2 weeks, at our next meeting, we will present to them a working demo of the project using their provided test programs, on their server. With that goal in mind, by the end of this next week I hope to have the C++ program complete, so that the following week I can work on getting Matt's json parser integrated with it so it can read from the config file.</p>
