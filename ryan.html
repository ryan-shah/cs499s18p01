	<h1>Weekly Contributions</h1>
	<h2>Week 1 (2/2/18 - 2/9/18)</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we met with Don Fishback and his partners in order to discuss the details of the project. Once this was ironed out, we spent the remainder of the week pondering how we might implement this project before our meeting on Friday. During this meeting we built the basis of our project website and discussed what PHP Framework we might use for the project. While we had originally discussed using codeigniter, some of us participated in a hackathon in Louisville (DerbyHacks) over the weekend where we learned there may be advantages to using Laravel instead. This will require more research but will probably be our framework of choice.</p>

	<h2>Week 2 (2/10/18 - 2/17/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was largely unproductive as we had little contact from Don and Co. They encountered a major issue at work and were too busy to provide us with the tools needed to begin our work. I spent this time doing research on Larvel and how php frameworks work, until thursday when we were given login information to their server. We met the following day to go over what we can access, as we will be working on the production server, and to double check requirements. At the end of the week we came up with topics for each of us to work on, I will be focusing on how Threads work in PHP/C++.</p>
        <h2>Week 3 (2/18/18 - 2/24/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on getting a working example of threads working in C++. Once I was able to initiate a number of threads I focused on creating some example shell programs. Each of these were quite simple and just called the "sleep" command. The purpose of this was to prove that the threads were being executed concurrently as the sleep commands should terminate in order of length. The program worked successfully and proved that our project was indeed possible and can be completed on time. The next step is going to be creating a Class that contains each programs information. Additionally we made plans with what needs to be done by the end of the next week by my fellow groupmates. This includes a database schema and simple website layout.</p>
	<h2>Week 4 (2/25/18 - 3/3/18)</h2>
	<p>This week I focused on working with the group as a whole to prepare our midterm presentation. As a part of this, we were able to develop the design for the website and getting a good start on the database schema. These were incorporated in the powerpoint which we will rehearse next week before we present on Wednesday. Additionally I focused on improving the C++ program and have reached the conclusion that I will need go launch child processes within threads, adding a new level of complexity to the system. <p>
	<h2>Week 5 (3/4/18 - 3/10/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was focused on getting our presentation fully polished and creating designs for the website to show our customers. We had our practice presentation on Monday, following which we made several changes to the slides and our presentation style. On Wed. we presented to the class (I think fairly well) and on Friday we met with our customer and gave them the same presentation to bring them up to speed with our work. Additionally we got verification on our website designs.</p>
	<h2>Week 6 (3/11/18 - 3/18/18)</h2>
	<p>This week was spring break and I planned to be very productive on this project. Alas life got in my way and I was only able to dedicate a couple of hours to it on the 18th. I spent this time following the work I did in week 4 when I thought I would have to fork() inside threads (creating child processes) in order to get the PID of the programs we call. This however was not the case as the PID returned this way was different than the PID of the program called via the system() command. I then attempted to use one of the many exec() calls ( execl() to be specific ) as a call to that replaces the current process with the one invoked. My thought was that it would simply replace the thread (or in another trial the forked process) but instead the first call of exec() replaced the entire spyder process. The work around I have found is to call the process in one thread and then have another thread go through the /proc/{pid}/stat files until I find the pid of a process with the correct name. This however has its own issue as there is a race condition between the system() call in the first thread and the searching for the directory in the second. My work around for this is calling sleep(1) in the second thread so the system() call goes through, but this feels like bad programming and I will be searching for an alternative solution</p>
