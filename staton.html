	<h1>Elijah's Weekly Contributions</h1>
	  <h2>Week 1 (2/3 - 2/9)</h2>
	    <p>We met with out customer to hammer out the objective of the project, as well as recieve certain specifications that we are recommended to follow.  Afterwards, we did not meet to work on the project again until Friday.  I worked with the team to develop the begennings on our webpage.  We also discussed frameworks we may utilize when developing our project, such as CodeIgnighter and Laravel.  We haven't reached a conclusion, but I have a sneaking suspicion we will end up going with Laravel.</p>
	  <h2>Week 2 (2/10 - 2/16)</h2>
	    <p>We did not accomplish as much as we would have liked.  Due to some stock market issues faced by our customer, they were only able to provide our team with  a server only a couple of days before the meeting.  The meeting ended up only being about 10 minutes long as a result.  During the meeting, I asked if there was any preference as to which platform would be used to the GUI that I would make for Spydr's application page as well as any preferences for layout.  No preferences were listed, but they mentioned that they generally use Bootstrap and jQuery.  Unfortunately, there was nothing else to talk about.</p>
	  <h2>Week 3 (2/17 - 2/23)</h2>
	    <p>This week, I began seriously considering what the front-end of the project would look like.  The customers talked about a template that they use that involves Bootstrap and jQuery, but beyond that, I need to understand what my partners in the back-end want to do so that I can have a better idea of what we need the webpage to look like.  Aside from this and discussing what the database should contain, there was mot much I have done personally to move the project forward.  Hopefully that changes as we work toward having a design to present both to Presentation U and to the class.</p>
	  <h2>Week 4 (2/24 - 3/2)</h2>
	    <p>I have done a considerable amount of work this week.  For starters, I installed Laravel and it's extensions with all of the difficulty that came with doing that.  Next, after recieving a rough sketch of the website from Ryan, I began working on designing the website component of the project.  The team also met up on Friday to come up with the slides for our presentations both to PresU and the class.  As I am the one developing the website component, I was assigned to present on both the website and the design for the website.  If I'm lucky, I'll get even more done next week, so that I may relax for spring break.</p>
	  <h2>Week 5 (3/3 - 3/9)</h2>
	    <p>This week was focused on preparation for the presentations to PresU and the class.  With regards to that, I made progress in visualizing a rough draft of a design provided by Ryan.  To that end, I provided the tentative screens on the webpage.  Aside from this, not much progress to the project was provided beyond advancing the project design.</p>
	  <h2>Week 6 (3/10 - 3/16)</h2>
	    <p>I had planned on making considerable progress toward the website, but the only thing I have done was move the search bar from the topbar to the sidebar in accordance with the design specification.  Unfortunately, as of the last time I have checked (which was March 12), I have messed up the search bar such that the space around it is red rather than the grey that the rest of the sidebar is.  Other than that, there is nothing else to report from me.</p>
	  <h2>Week 7 (3/17 - 3/23)</h2>
	    <p>This time around, I believe I have made up for what I did not do over spring break.  With Alijah and I working together, we have made considerable progress towards the website.  We now have a working template for the website (using modals, navbars, and flexible containers), as well as a website flowchart for the class website.  I hope that we can have the database elements in a state that the website can work off of in the coming weeks.  On top of that, we have started looking through the class website to look for ways to improve upon the clarity of the content.</p>
	  <h2>Week 8 (3/24 - 3/30)</h2>
	    <p>Preoccupied with other classes, there are few things that I have managed to do this week.  Alijah and I have begun integrating a hard-coded version of the database into the website.  Once we have the actual database, changing the hard-coded part to grab the actual database component should be relatively simple.  On top of this, Ryan, Matt and I have started developing the test cases that have been placed onto the website.  These will likely be changed as we get closer to completing the project, but until then, they seem sufficient.</p>
	  <h2>Week 9 (3/31 - 4/6)</h2>
	    <p>A good amount of progress has been made.  The database components are now up an running, and the website has been given some visual consistancies.  This includes the sidebar and runlist flex container now using the same functionality when the user clicks a program or runlist respectively.  The team also worked together to create the testing file.  Some improvements need to be made to that file, but they will be simple to add.  The only major thing that needs to be included is the creation and modification of a config.json file so the website and C++ component can communicate with each other.  We seem to be on track to completing this project on time, and I personally can't wait!</p>
