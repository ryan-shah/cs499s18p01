	<h1>Elijah's Weekly Contributions</h1>
	  <h2>Week 1 (2/2 - 2/9)</h2>
	    <p>We met with out customer to hammer out the objective of the project, as well as recieve certain specifications that we are recommended to follow.  Afterwards, we did not meet to work on the project again until Friday.  I worked with the team to develop the begennings on our webpage.  We also discussed frameworks we may utilize when developing our project, such as CodeIgnighter and Laravel.  We haven't reached a conclusion, but I have a sneaking suspicion we will end up going with Laravel.</p>
	  <h2>Week 2 (2/10 - 2/16)</h2>
	    <p>We did not accomplish as much as we would have liked.  Due to some stock market issues faced by our customer, they were only able to provide our team with  a server only a couple of days before the meeting.  The meeting ended up only being about 10 minutes long as a result.  During the meeting, I asked if there was any preference as to which platform would be used to the GUI that I would make for Spydr's application page as well as any preferences for layout.  No preferences were listed, but they mentioned that they generally use Bootstrap and jQuery.  Unfortunately, there was nothing else to talk about.</p>
	  <h2>Week 3 (2/17 - 2/23)</h2>
	    <p>This week, I began seriously considering what the front-end of the project would look like.  The customers talked about a template that they use that involves Bootstrap and jQuery, but beyond that, I need to understand what my partners in the back-end want to do so that I can have a better idea of what we need the webpage to look like.  Aside from this and discussing what the database should contain, there was mot much I have done personally to move the project forward.  Hopefully that changes as we work toward having a design to present both to Presentation U and to the class.</p>
